This is a Unity 5.0.3f project of a Tactical RPG game which the codename "A World in Flames".

Currently the development is in standby as the main objective of it was as a undergraduate thesis of the course of
Systems and Digital Media in the Federal University of Ceará that occurred in late July of 2017.

Only the code was mine. None of the images, sounds and music are my doing, all rigths to the creators.
